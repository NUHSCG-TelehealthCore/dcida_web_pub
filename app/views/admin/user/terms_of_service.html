      The gist:
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    We offer a web service that enables people to create preference surveys, risk communication tools and decision aids and we would
    <strong>
      love
    </strong>
     for you to use it. Our service is designed to give you as much control and ownership over what goes in your tool as possible. However, you need to be responsible in what you create and publish. In particular, make sure that none of the prohibited items listed below appear on your site or get linked to from your site (things like patient identifiable information, copyrighted material used without permission, spam, viruses, or hate content) as you will be liable. If you are creating information that may guide people&rsquo;s health choices, be sure to include a disclaimer that is appropriate for your jurisdiction e.g. &ldquo;this information is not intended to replace the advice of a health care provider&rdquo;. You will own your data, we will keep your data safe and secure, and will not use it for any other purpose. If you ask us to delete it, we will remove it from our servers.

      Terms of Service:
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Please read these Terms of Service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) carefully before using our website (&ldquo;Service&rdquo;). These Terms take effect when you click an &ldquo;I Accept&rdquo; button or check box presented with these Terms, or, if earlier, when you use any of the Services, or if you have actively used the Service. You represent to us that you are lawfully able to enter into contracts (e.g., you are not a minor). If you are agreeing to these Terms for an entity, such as the entity you work for, you represent to us that you have legal authority to bind that entity.

      Description of DECIDAPP Services
      <ul>
        <li>
          DECIDAPP (&ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo;) provides a variety of Services, including access to open source computer software programs developed by us that facilitate and automate the process of conducting preference surveys, prognostic risk tools, and patient decision aids and related systems, security, updates and support services, via a web browser and the Internet.
        </li>
        <li>
          For purposes of these Terms, &ldquo;you&rdquo; means you and the entity you represent and also refers to any person accessing the Services by any method on your behalf.
        </li>
        <li>
          For purposes of these Terms, data includes all information you input into program such as content and questions, and the responses and reports and any other information input or generated on behalf of you in connection with the Services (&ldquo;Data&rdquo;).
        </li>
        <li>
          Subject to your compliance with these Terms and your payment of any applicable fees, DECIDAPP grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free, revocable license to use the Services for your own internal business or academic purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          DECIDAPP may make modifications to the Services at any time, as it deems appropriate, and in its sole discretion.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <ol start="2">
    <li>
      Your Data
      <ul>
        <li>
          You own all right, title and interest in all Data entered into the Service including the design and respondent information, and survey responses. In addition, all reports and downloads derived from your Data are also owned by you. All such Data are deemed Confidential Information (defined below) and will not be utilized by DECIDAPP for any purpose other than to perform its obligations under these Terms.
        </li>
        <li>
          We do not sell or make available specific information about our customers or their Data, except as required pursuant to a regulation, law or court order. We maintain a database of user information that is used only for internal purposes such as technical support, and notifying users of changes or enhancements to the Services.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your data will be stored on secure servers based at St Paul&rsquo;s hospital in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Availability is keeping the systems working in a responsive way. Availability is mainly protected by a perimeter firewall that allows minimal services to the Internet. We use a 5th generation firewall installed in July 2017. This firewall goes far beyond packet filtering for protection. All internal network computers also have to have their system firewalls turned on to protect again malware that arrives via email or USB sticks. All email is filtered for viruses, SPAM and other malware with a dedicated firewall email gateway.
            </li>
            <li>
              Outside users can connect to our internal servers using a VPN that we protect with 14 character passwords and dual factor authentication.
            </li>
            <li>
              The web services provided to the Internet including the INFORM servers are not directly available on the Internet. There is a proxy server that protects the INFORM servers from direct attack. The proxy servers send the encrypted HTTPS requests to the internal INFORM servers. All data is encrypted in transport with HTTPS from your client computers to the backend web servers including the Inform servers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Inform passwords are created by users. Account lockout is enforced after 3 unsuccessful attempts to logon with a username and password. This protects from brute force attempts using thousands of passwords.
            </li>
            <li>
              Password complexity is enforced. Users are not allowed to use dictionary words for their passwords. Complexity is enforced by obligatory use of at least one upper case and one lower case alphabetic character, one number and one special character.
            </li>
            <li>
              For the servers and the networking devices, physical security is maintained with both magnetic locks and dead bolts. The magnetic locks operate in a fail-safe manner, so the mag locks become unlocked during a fire alarm. When an area is unstaffed, the dead bolt is always in the locked position. The server area has a fail-safe door that is dead bolted at night and a fail-secure door at the final door before the dead-bolted server room doors.
